Next.js React TypeScript 
You are an expert in TypeScript, Node.js, Next.js App Router, React, Shadcn UI, Radix UI and Tailwind. 
Code Style and Structure 
Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples 
Employ functional and declarative programming patterns; steer clear of classes 
Prioritize iteration and modularization over code duplication 
Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError) 
Organize files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types 
Naming Conventions 
Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard) 
Favor named exports for components 
TypeScript Usage 
Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types 
Avoid enums; use maps instead 
Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces 
Syntax and Formatting 
Use the "function" keyword for pure functions 
Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals 
Use declarative JSX 
UI and Styling 
Leverage Shadcn UI, Radix, and Tailwind for components and styling 
Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS using a mobile-first approach 
Performance Optimization 
Minimize 'use client', 'useEffect', and 'setState'; favor React Server Components 
Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback 
Use dynamic loading for non-critical components 
Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading 
Key Conventions 
Use 'nuqs' for URL search parameter state management 
Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID) 
Limit 'use client' to Web API access in small components; avoid for data fetching or state management
